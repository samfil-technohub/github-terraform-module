## Documentation

This is a module implements a great bulk of provisioning various github resources - repository, teams, branches webhook, project etc. It sub-modular designed to allow for orchestrating resources which makes sense collectively and as well give room to strip some overhead if the use case does not apply for the project.

For instance, a user could choose to stand a repository with this module without the need for adding teams or instanting a project management if they do not deem so. Some arguments for the repository can also be turned off if the user do not wish to activate them.
